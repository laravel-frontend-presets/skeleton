# A Boilerplate repo for presets

This package makes it easy to use [:preset-name](:link-to-website) with Laravel 5.5+.

**Note:** Replace ```:preset-name```, ```:link-to-website```, ```:author-name``` and ```:author-username``` on this file, and then delete this line.

**Note:** Make sure you replace all the instances of the word ```skeleton``` or ```Skeleton``` on this file, the `composer.json` file and on the `src/` folder, and to rename the files. You can delete this line after.

This is where your description should go. Add a little code example so build can understand real quick how the package can be used. Try and limit it to a paragraph or two.
